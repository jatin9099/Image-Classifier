# Image Classification with CIFAR-10 Dataset using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

This project demonstrates how to build an image classification model using the CIFAR-10 dataset and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The goal of the project is to classify 60,000 32x32 color images into one of 10 predefined classes (airplane, automobile, bird, etc.).

## Dataset

The CIFAR-10 dataset contains 60,000 images, divided into 10 classes:

1. Airplane
2. Automobile
3. Bird
4. Cat
5. Deer
6. Dog
7. Frog
8. Horse
9. Ship
10. Truck

The dataset is split into 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images. Each image is 32x32 pixels with three color channels (RGB).

## Approach

1. **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset is preprocessed by normalizing the pixel values for faster convergence and better performance of the model.
   
2. **CNN Architecture**: The model uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with the following components:
   - Convolutional layers to extract features from images.
   - Max-pooling layers to reduce dimensionality.
   - Fully connected layers for final classification.
   - ReLU activation functions to introduce non-linearity.
   - Softmax function in the final layer to predict class probabilities.

3. **Model Evaluation**: The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow or Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cifar10-image-classification.git

cd cifar10-image-classification

pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
Train the Model: You can train the model by running the following command:

bash
python train_model.py
This will begin training the CNN model using the CIFAR-10 training dataset.

Evaluate the Model: After training, you can evaluate the model on the test dataset:
python evaluate_model.py

Predict: You can use the trained model to make predictions on new images by running the predict_image.py script.

Model Performance
The CNN model is evaluated based on accuracy and other metrics. The goal is to achieve a classification accuracy greater than 80%. You can experiment with different architectures and hyperparameters to improve performance.

Future Work
Hyperparameter Tuning: Try adjusting parameters like the learning rate, batch size, or the number of layers.
Data Augmentation: Use data augmentation techniques like rotation, flipping, or cropping to improve model generalization.
Advanced Models: Explore using more advanced architectures like ResNet or VGG for better performance.
